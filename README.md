# How to make Bootstrap image responsive?

Add class `.img-fluid` to make your bootstrap image responsive. It will apply `max-width: 100%;` and `height: auto;` to the image, which makes it always fit the parent element.

```html
<img src="https://mdbootstrap.com/img/new/slides/041.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="..." />
```
